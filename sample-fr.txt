### Al-Fatiha
##
In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.
##
[All] praise is [due] to Allah, Lord of the worlds - 
##
The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,
##
Sovereign of the Day of Recompense.
##
It is You we worship and You we ask for help.
##
Guide us to the straight path -
##
The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray.
